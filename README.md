## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Delivery1](Delivery1.png)

From the Pr(>|t|) values, it can be determined that vehicle length and ground clearnace provide a non-random amount of variance. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero since the p-value is so small. Thus the data is unlikely to fall under the null hypothesis and the slope must have value. The linear model predicts the mpg effectively as determined by the R-squared value. The r-squared value is 0.7149 which means the model will correcly represent about 71 percent of the data.

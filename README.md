## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Delivery1](Delivery1.png)

From the Pr(>|t|) values, it can be determined that vehicle length and ground clearnace provide a non-random amount of variance. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero since the p-value is so small. Thus the data is unlikely to fall under the null hypothesis and the slope must have value. The linear model predicts the mpg effectively as determined by the R-squared value. The r-squared value is 0.7149 which means the model will correcly represent about 71 percent of the data.

### Lot Summary

From the lot summary, Lot 1 and Lot 2 both have a mean and median of 1500. Lot 3 has a slightly lower mean and median with 1496 and 1498 respectively. In our given situation, the variance in the suspension coils must not exceed 100. Lot 1 and 2 meet this restriction while Lot 3 does not. In the total summary, the variance is 62 and thus the total data meets the restriction of having a variance less than 100.
